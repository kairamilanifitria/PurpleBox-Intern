Objectives :  The  aim  of  the  workshop  was  to  understand  how  family  medicine  registrars (postgraduate trainees in family medicine) in Africa learn in the workplace.

Methods : Thirty-five  trainers  and  registrars  from  nine  African  countries,  the  United Kingdom,  United  States  and  Sweden  participated.  South  Africa  was  represented  by  the universities of Cape Town, Limpopo, Pretoria, Sefako Makgatho, Stellenbosch, Walter Sisulu and Witwatersrand.

Results: Six  major  themes  were  identified:  (1)  context  is  critical,  (2)  learning  style  of  the registrar and (teaching style) of the supervisor, (3) learning portfolio is utilised, (4) interactions between registrar and supervisor, (5) giving and receiving feedback and (6) the competence of the supervisor.

Conclusion :  The  training of family physicians across Africa shares many common themes. However, there are also big differences among the various countries and even programmes within countries. The way forward would include exploring the local contextual enablers that influence the learning conversations between trainees and their supervisors. Family medicine training  institutions  and  organisations  (such  as  WONCA  Africa  and  the  South  African Academy of Family Physicians) have a critical role to play in supporting trainees and trainers towards  developing  local  competencies  which  facilitate  learning  in  the  clinical  workplace dominated by service delivery pressures.

## Introduction

This article reports on the findings of a workshop held at the joint 5th World Organisation of Family Doctors (WONCA) Africa and 20th National Family Practitioners Conference in Tshwane, South Africa, in August 2017. Postgraduate training for family medicine in Africa takes place in the clinical workplace at the bedside or next to the patient in the clinic, district hospital or regional hospital. 1,2 Direct observation of the registrar by the supervisor with a learning conversation that evokes reflection and provides feedback is central to both training and assessment processes. 3

Worldwide,  workplace-based  assessment  (WBA)  and  learning  has  been  recognised  as  the preferred  way  to  train  and  assess  postgraduate  students.   It  is  well  known  that  learning  and 4 assessment are not dependent on any one method, but require a variety of educational strategies to deliver on the curriculum, which are best embedded in clinical practice as an authentic context. 5 However, many challenges in the health service environment exist, which may impact on learning. In many instances, WBA boils down to a tick box exercise, where supervisors tick indicators or scores  on  a  form,  without  giving  any  narrative  feedback,  and  summative  assessments  may overshadow formative assessments. Even in high-income countries like the United Kingdom, many challenges exist in implementing a portfolio of learning to capture WBA. 6  This has prompted the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom recently to suggest that one rather talks about the so-called supervised learning events (SLEs) instead of WBA. 7

The World Organisation of Family Doctors and the South African Academy of Family Physicians (SAAFP)  have  established  standards  for  the  postgraduate  training  of  family  physicians. 8,9

However,  family  medicine  is  a  relatively  new  specialty  in many African countries, which adds to the challenges around training and supervision in the context of large rural areas, massive health needs and minimal resources. 10

The  aim  of  the  workshop  was  to  understand  how  family medicine registrars (postgraduate trainees in family medicine) in  Africa  learn  in  the  workplace.  We  particularly  wanted  to explore  the  interaction  between  the  registrar  and  supervisor in the workplace, captured in a portfolio of learning, and in the African  context.  We  sought  a  clearer  understanding  of  what it  means  to  be  observed  while  conducting  a  consultation  or performing  a  procedure,  as  well  as  understanding  the  local experience of giving or receiving feedback, and how various educational meetings are conducted.

## Participants and process

Thirty-five people  participated  in  a  2-h  workshop  and included trainers and trainees from nine African countries, the United Kingdom, United States and Sweden (see Table 1). South  Africa  was  represented  by  the  universities  of  Cape Town,  Limpopo,  Pretoria,  Sefako  Makgatho,  Stellenbosch, Walter Sisulu and Witwatersrand.

We started with an introduction and then divided into buzz pairs (pairs were allowed to form spontaneously, regardless of the trainer or trainee status of the participants). In the buzz pairs, we explored the questions of how do I teach or learn, supervise  or  be  supervised,  and  assess  or  be  assessed. This was followed by an interactive focus group discussion on  the  reflections  created  by  the  buzz  pair  discussions (a guiding style was employed to facilitate this discussion). The  group  reflections  were  captured  on  a  flip  chart  by  a scribe.  Common  themes  were  identified.  Clarification  was sought and  validated immediately  with the workshop participants. A  preliminary  draft  of  this  report  was  shared with the workshop participants after the conference.

## The major themes

Six major themes were identified and are discussed below.

## Context is critical

The physical place where trainees are based is a key factor in appropriate  training  for  family  medicine.  There  must  be  a balance between training in a district hospital and primary health care (PHC) settings. Participants spoke of accreditation of a 'teaching campus' in the district where training would be provided  by  a  network  of  different  facilities  or  locations. Rotation in specialist disciplines at referral hospitals tended to  cause  a  sense  of  disconnect  with  the  ethos  of  family medicine. In some programmes, registrars were based mostly in a tertiary setting, without on-site supervision by a family physician. Trainees then experienced a sense of dissonance, often missing the psychosocial aspects of patient care, as the specialist  environment  was  mainly  biomedical  in  nature. Without regular meetings with a family physician, it became a challenge to change the thinking of the trainee after his or her tertiary setting exposure.

The placement of registrars in the district was seen as strategic in terms of building the capacity of health teams. The risk, however,  is  that  service  provision  overshadows  learning, with  a  perception  that  the  registrar  is  there  to  cover  staff shortages.  Indeed,  registrars  often  provide  supervision  to mid-level health workers and medical assistants (similar to clinical officers or clinical associates).

Within  the  right  context  (district),  the  supervisor  plays  a key  role  in  modelling  to  the  registrar,  for  example,  how to approach  patients with challenging conditions in a comprehensive way, while making  use of appropriate resources.

In  some  programmes,  the  initial  training  model  started with international partners using a hub and spokes model, with training mainly occurring in ambulatory care settings (the spokes), linked with rotations in specialist departments (the hub of the regional hospital). A regular challenge is the geographic distances between the universities in the city and the district hospital in the periphery.

## Learning style of the registrar and (teaching style) of the supervisor

The success of the current educational emphasis on self-directed  life-long  learning  was  perceived  to  be  heavily influenced by the previous learning background  of  the registrar.  Some  medical  schools  promoted  more  problembased learning, with some emphasising self-directed learning, while  others  still  adhered  to  mainly  didactic  teaching.  This determined the registrar's ability to drive their own learning. Furthermore, the previous learning and teaching exposure of the  supervisor  also  became  relevant,  especially  if  their  own training  was  influenced  by  a  traditional  specialty  versus  a family medicine approach. The importance of aligning learning styles and creating continuity between the undergraduate and postgraduate  learning  phases  was  recognised.  Participants confirmed that the patient remains the best teacher. Registrars learnt best through seeing patients and then studying around them, as their learning needs were unmasked.

## Learning portfolio is utilised

The  group  explored  the  various  components  of  a  learning portfolio.  In  many  programmes,  a  learning  plan  is  drawn up  per  rotation,  with  objectives  linked  to  the  curriculum. Areas  of  existing  competence  and  gaps  in  prior  learning are identified and converted into learning objectives. Conversations with the supervisor help to develop a strategy to  achieve  the  learning  objectives.  Participants  were  using tools like the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (CEX), logbook and  direct  observation  of  procedural  skills  (DOPS).  These were often used at patient encounters and in meetings with their supervisor.

In  terms of WBA, participants utilised a global assessment tool. Typically, there was one assessment at the end of each rotation,  completed by both registrar and family physician supervisor, which was also used for shared reflection. There were  also  continuous  assessments  every  2  weeks  within training modules, where the registrars presented a specific topic to the supervisor, with a short 'quiz' involving a number of questions on the topic. Some programmes had quarterly assessments.

One  of  the  challenges  experienced  with  the  portfolio  of learning, which is mostly paper-based at present, is implementation  of  the  portfolio  by  the  registrars  during every day clinical practice, as well as training of supervisors (faculty development).

## Interactions between registrar and supervisor

We  wanted  to  understand  exactly how  registrars and supervisors interacted in the workplace. Many programmes reported  weekly  contact  sessions  that  included  academic activities, for example  a  journal  club. In some  places, educational  meetings  were  held  weekly,  with  an  agenda including a seminar, topic discussion or a DOPS. Participants spoke of an 'educational prescription' to 'treat' the identified learning needs of the registrar, which was a tool used daily, similarly to discussing the treatment for a patient, discussed with the consultant.

In  some  places  where  there  was  no  immediate  regular supervisor, participants made use of peer supervision from within the registrar's context, by a senior registrar assigned by  the  main  supervisor.  Regarding  being  observed  during patient  consultations,  participants  mentioned  that  being videoed was an alternative to direct observation, as long as the patient had given permission. An 8-10-min video could then be viewed and assessed at a later stage by the supervisor. Many participants felt uncomfortable with being observed or had little experience and even less training in direct observation.  Registrars  should  be  comfortable  during  the observation, and supervisors needed to listen 'educationally'. We  explored  the  four  simple  rules  for  observation,  as described by Holmboe 11 :

- · Correct positioning : As the rater, try to avoid being in the line  of  sight  of  either  the  patient  or  trainee,  especially
- when  they  are  communicating.  Use  the  principle  of triangulation. However, during physical examinations be sure you can view the trainee's techniques accurately.
- · Minimise  external  interruptions :  Let  your  staff  know you will be with the trainee for 5-10 min, avoid taking routine calls or letting staff enter the room.
- · Avoid  intrusions :  Don't  interject  or  interrupt  if  at  all possible.  Once  you  interject  yourself  into  the  traineepatient interaction, the visit is permanently  altered. However, there may be times at some point in the visit where you need to interject yourself in order to correct misinformation or risky management from the trainee.
- · Be prepared : Know before you enter the room what your goals  are  for  the  observation  session.  For  example,  if  a physical examination, have the trainee present the history first;  then  you  will  know  what  the  key  elements  of  the physical examination should be.

## Giving and receiving feedback

It was  important  to  choose  the  timing  of  feedback.  For example, when a registrar was post-call, this was not a good time for feedback. Feedback should not be given in front of the  patient.  However,  the  possibility  of  patients  and  other members of the health care team giving feedback in a multisource format was seen as acceptable.

When giving feedback, it is important to allow the registrar to reflect first, and allow for time to reflect, with the supervisor being  silent,  or  waiting.  It  is  important  to  agree  on  what needs  to  be  worked  on.  Feedback  should  be  honest  and specific.  The  relationship  between  the  supervisor  and  the registrar  may  enhance  or  detract  the  potential  for  learning through feedback. The power gradient between supervisor and registrar may be a challenge, especially in many African cultures where seniority of age supersedes level of education.

A culture of feedback needs to be established in the institution or  organisation.  The  same  principles  of  feedback  apply  to undergraduates, postgraduates, junior and senior clinicians. Supervisors may also need to video their own consultations and reflect on their modelling ability. One participant stressed that 'our health system needs more feedback' and a blamefree learning culture. Giving and receiving feedback needs to be normalised, become part of everyday practice and not be seen as just for students. This requires building relationships, which are open for feedback.

When giving  feedback,  focus  the  conversation  around  the standard or norm (the issue at hand) which was not met (and not  the  person).  This  creates  a  triangle  in  which  the  issue becomes the focus and separate to the people receiving or providing feedback. This will help to avoid a confrontational style or tone. This approach may also be used in meetings or email conversations. Always aim to provide feedback which is constructive and not critical. It is important to give praise when things go well. Such compliments help to establish a culture of appreciation, build self-esteem and reinforce the correct  attributes.  And  when  things  are  not  going  well,

feedback should be helpful and even rescuing. Open feedback between peers (registrar to registrar) was also encouraged.

The  pros  and  cons  of  oral  and  written  feedback  were considered,  as  well  as  whether  feedback  should  be  given in  person  or  via  a  'Skype  call'.  The  value  of  face-to-face feedback allows for the registrar and supervisor to appreciate the  non-verbal  cues  that  contribute  to  communicating  an unambiguous message. It is important to capture or document the feedback provided, especially for the registrar in difficulty. The registrar's  reflection  (and  supervisor's  reflection)  on  the feedback exchange should be captured in a journal or diary, as  this  will  allow  for  follow-up  conversations  or  reflections later on.

## The competence of the supervisor

The  clinical  competence  of  the  clinical  teacher  should  be good. The teacher or supervisor should be 'clinically relevant' (as opposed to 'we never see him or her'). It is an accepted part  of  career  progression  that  clinical  supervisors  may experience their roles evolving to less direct clinical contact. But  it  is  important  that  the  registrar  feels  that  his  or  her supervisor 'understands the clinical context' and is able to 'walk  the  walk  and  talk  the  talk'. 12 This  will  enable  the supervisor  to  provide  meaningful  feedback  to  a  registrar who will value this feedback based on the credibility of the supervisor's background.

## Reflection on workshop

The group appreciated the richness of the discussion and the value  of  having  a  variety  of  countries  represented  in  the workshop. The group members expressed feeling encouraged and felt motivated to use 'small moments, little bits, part of the mini-CEX' during learning interactions in the workplace (teachable  moments).  This  will  allow  the  supervisors  and registrars to be 'more real' in the workplace, as opposed to striving for the hard-to-reach  perfect or ideal learning interactions. It will necessitate a more honest and pragmatic approach  to  harness  these  learning  moments.  Ongoing discussions  are  needed  around  the  validity  of  continuous assessments  in  the  workplace  for  national  examinations, such as the Fellowship of the College of Family Physicians of South Africa (FCFP[SA]), and the contribution of the learning portfolio to exit examination results. Collaborative training projects, like Training the Clinical Trainers (TCT) project and 'FamLEAP'  initiative,  are  trying  to  address  the  need  for training of supervisors in South Africa and also now Malawi and  other  countries  in  Africa  in  basic  workplace-based educational skills, such as formative assessment and giving feedback. 13

## Conclusion

It was clear from this workshop discussion that the training  of  family  physicians  across  Africa  shares  many common  themes.  However,  there  are  also  big  differences among the various countries and even programmes within countries. The way forward would include exploring the  local  contextual  enablers  that  influence  the  learning conversations between trainees and their supervisors. Family medicine  training  institutions  and  organisations  (such  as WONCA Africa and SAAFP) have a critical role to play in supporting  trainees  and  trainers  towards  developing  local competencies that facilitate learning in the clinical workplace dominated by service delivery pressures.
