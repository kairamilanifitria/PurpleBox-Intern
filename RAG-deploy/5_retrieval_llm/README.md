# Retrieval-LLM

To run:
1. Run the ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install depedencies in the ```requirements.txt```
2. Run the ```main.py```
3. First time running the ```main.py```, it will take longer time because nltk downloads, but for the second running it will be normal
4. I add the ```exit```, ```quit```, and ```new chat``` commands for user.
   - ```exit``` or ```quit``` if you want to exit the conversation
   - ```new_chat``` if you want to send new query (with no previous history chat)
