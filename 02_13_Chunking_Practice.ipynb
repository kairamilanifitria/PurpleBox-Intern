A novel sentiment score equation is proposed to represent the impact of intraday news on forecasting next-period stock return and volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers, a very vibrant industry sector. This work improves the forecast accuracy by addressing news bias, memory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in sentiment direction. More importantly, it extends the use of the remarkable tool of change of Probability Measure developed in the finance of Asset Pricing to NLP forecasting by constructing a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, obtained from a redistribution of the weights in the probability space, meant to correct for excessive or insufficient news.  \n",

Previous studies have examined the theoretical and empirical role of sentiment in market dynamics, highlighting its impact on investors' decision-making and trading patterns [12, 17]. Furthermore, research [2] by Baker and Wurgler (2006) followed by others has shown a significant relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns, providing a foundation for sentiment-based trading strategies .  \n",
            "Our manuscript builds on the work of Deveikyte et al [6], who applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to forecast market prices and volatility. The authors proposed a thorough approach to compute the sentiment score and forecast the directions of the next day's market return and volatility in the case of FTSE100 stocks. In this research, we choose semiconductors, a very vibrant industry of this decade, as the sector for analyzing news and market data.  \n",

            "Sentiment analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focuses on quantifying the emotional tone and intent conveyed in textual data. NLP itself is a rapidly growing area of machine learning (ML) that enables computers to process and understand human language through algorithms and statistical models such as the founding work by Jurafsky and Martin (2000) [14]. Within NLP, sentiment analysis applies techniques to assess positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in data, often used for applications like market forecasting and consumer behavior analysis [15].  \n",
            "In this context, sentiment is defined as the emotional polarity associated with a piece of text, often derived from news articles, tweets, or other media. It is typically measured using computational methods such as dictionary-based approaches or ML models. For example, Vader, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool, evaluates sentiment scores ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive [13].  \n",
            "In their 2022 paper, Deveikyte et al identified a significant negative correlation between daily negative sentiment and observed market volatility and develop a sentiment-based model for predicting directional volatility and market returns [6]. Building on their findings, we aimed to enhance the predictive relationship between news sentiment and stock performance by refining the methods used to calculate key financial metrics.  \n",

            "Regarding the change of probability measures, it has been revealed as a remarkable tool in the finance of Asset Pricing. It started with the seminal paper by Harrison and Kreps (1979) [11], who proposed under No Arbitrage and constant interest rates a new probability measure that incorporates the risk premium attached to equities and leads to martingales for discounted stock prices. The 'forward measure\" introduced in Geman (1989) [8] was constructed to address the challenges created by stochastic interest rates in the valuation of risky cash flows.  \n",

By integrating advanced sentiment modeling techniques, we observe substantial accuracy improvements, which pave the way for innovative theoretical contributions and practical applications in financial analysis.  \n",

(or -0 68% . ). We note however, that despite this small number, the accuracy of the prediction was improved by 8% .  \n",

The WaveOptimizer Best Model 1 is marked as having 0.721% accuracy, with an initial y-value of 0.670 and an increasing trend over the remaining data points, reaching approximately 0.755% by the end.  \n",

In the prediction of market return direction, validation accuracy improves from 51 7% . in the baseline model to 70 0% . with a LDA model using adjusted scores, and further to 78 3% . with the optimized scores. Similarly, for volatility direction, accuracy increases from 53 8% . in the baseline model to 72 1% . and 75 0% . in the corresponding models. These substantial improvements validate the effectiveness of our methodology.  \n",
            "The observed accuracy increase of +8 3% . for market return direction and +2 9% . for volatility direction highlights the refined precision achieved through optimized sentiment modeling. This improvement translates into more reliable predictions of market trends, a critical factor for decision-making during high-volatility scenarios and market crises.  \n",
            "Note that we do not claim the uniqueness of the hype-adjusted probability measure P a we are proposing, for two sets of reasons:  \n",
            "- 1. The way we define 'hype\" can vary based on the approach used to link news to market sentiment. For instance, other researchers may define hype using different NLP techniques, sentiment scoring models, or thresholds. There is no canonical way of defining hype, and our chosen approach is just one of many possibilities to bridge news sentiment with market behavior.\n",
            "- 2. Moreover, there could be multiple valid constructions of P a that align with the sentiment adjustments.  \n",
            "The flexibility in both defining hype and constructing the adjusted measure ensures the generality of the approach, allowing it to be adapted to various datasets and market contexts.  \n",
            "Regarding our potential future research, one avenue could be to derive and formalize a hype-adjusted volatility and option pricing under a hype-adjusted probability measure. Future work can explore integrating sentiment-guided adversarial learning frameworks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs) presented, for instance, by Zhang et al in [1], to enhance the ability of the model to adapt to dynamic market conditions. Further analysis of bias or subjectivity can also be conducted using tools like the Eikon Data API, as discussed earlier in the paper.  \n",
            "An important point to keep in mind is that market participants do not only trade on news. Some trade on the basis of technical analysis, such as moving averages (for commodities but for equities as well); a small category of market participants, called arbitragers, trade only if they have identified a strict arbitrage opportunity; some major hedge funds try to recognize 'statistical arbitrage\" patterns. Lastly, a category of fundamental analysts uses Capital Structure and Earnings as trading signals. All these strategies interact with each other, leading to market prices whose exact formation is beyond the scope of this paper.' metadata={'Header 2': '5 Model Results and Discussion'}\n",

            "Besides validating improvements in financial forecasting, these results lay the foundation for broader theoretical applications. A hype-adjusted probability measure is introduced to quantify and integrate market hypes, extending the framework beyond classical sentiment analysis.  \n",
            "Our model evaluates text tokens with greater accuracy, effectively capturing the influence of correlations and weights across subsets. A key advantage is its low sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial token scoring method, making it robust across varied data sources. The enhanced performance of our sentiment model is exhibited in the key result figure which shows the higher accuracy obtained in predicting market responses compared to baseline models.  \n",

A novel sentiment score equation is proposed to represent the impact of intraday news on forecasting next-period stock return and volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers, a very vibrant industry sector. This work improves the forecast accuracy by addressing news bias, memory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in sentiment direction. More importantly, it extends the use of the remarkable tool of change of Probability Measure developed in the finance of Asset Pricing to NLP forecasting by constructing a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, obtained from a redistribution of the weights in the probability space, meant to correct for excessive or insufficient news.  \n",

            "Sentiment has long been recognized as a key driver in financial markets, influencing both trading behavior and asset prices. Previous studies have examined the theoretical and empirical role of sentiment in market dynamics, highlighting its impact on investors' decision-making and trading patterns [12, 17]. Furthermore, research [2] by Baker and Wurgler (2006) followed by others has shown a significant relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns, providing a foundation for sentiment-based trading strategies .  \n",
            "Our manuscript builds on the work of Deveikyte et al [6], who applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to forecast market prices and volatility. The authors proposed a thorough approach to compute the sentiment score and forecast the directions of the next day's market return and volatility in the case of FTSE100 stocks. In this research, we choose semiconductors, a very vibrant industry of this decade, as the sector for analyzing news and market data.  \n",

            "Sentiment analysis, a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focuses on quantifying the emotional tone and intent conveyed in textual data. NLP itself is a rapidly growing area of machine learning (ML) that enables computers to process and understand human language through algorithms and statistical models such as the founding work by Jurafsky and Martin (2000) [14]. Within NLP, sentiment analysis applies techniques to assess positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in data, often used for applications like market forecasting and consumer behavior analysis [15]. In this context, sentiment is defined as the emotional polarity associated with a piece of text, often derived from news articles, tweets, or other media.\n",

Building on their findings, we aimed to enhance the predictive relationship between news sentiment and stock performance by refining the methods used to calculate key financial metrics.\n",

The regression provides an R-squared value to measure the proportion of variance in Y explained by X . This allows us to evaluate the predictive power of sentiment scores in explaining market dynamics.  \n",
            "Logistic regression is employed to predict the direction of daily market returns (dependent variable Y ) based on the compound sentiment score (independent variable X ). Here, Y is a binary variable indicating positive or negative market movements. The accuracy of the logistic regression model serves as a key metric for assessing its performance.  \n",
            "The optimal models are selected based on the highest validation accuracy (for logistic regression) and R-squared values (for OLS regression) across iterations.

            "Besides validating improvements in financial forecasting, these results lay the foundation for broader theoretical applications. A hype-adjusted probability measure is introduced to quantify and integrate market hypes, extending the framework beyond classical sentiment analysis.  \n",
            "Our model evaluates text tokens with greater accuracy, effectively capturing the influence of correlations and weights across subsets. A key advantage is its low sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial token scoring method, making it robust across varied data sources. The enhanced performance of our sentiment model is exhibited in the key result figure which shows the higher accuracy obtained in predicting market responses compared to baseline models.  \n",
            "Lastly, our hype-adjusted probability measure can arguably be valued as a theoretical bridge between the probabilistic finance of Asset Pricing and NLP prediction in Finance, two fields which are likely to intersect more and more in the near future.\n",

            "This article introduces a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure in the context of a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach for stock return and volatility forecasting. A novel sentiment score equation is proposed to represent the impact of intraday news on forecasting next-period stock return and volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers, a very vibrant industry sector. This work improves the forecast accuracy by addressing news bias, memory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in sentiment direction. More importantly, it extends the use of the remarkable tool of change of Probability Measure developed in the finance of Asset Pricing to NLP forecasting by constructing a Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, obtained from a redistribution of the weights in the probability space, meant to correct for excessive or insufficient news.  \n",

            "Sentiment has long been recognized as a key driver in financial markets, influencing both trading behavior and asset prices. Previous studies have examined the theoretical and empirical role of sentiment in market dynamics, highlighting its impact on investors' decision-making and trading patterns [12, 17]. Furthermore, research [2] by Baker and Wurgler (2006) followed by others has shown a significant relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns, providing a foundation for sentiment-based trading strategies .  \n",
            "Our manuscript builds on the work of Deveikyte et al [6], who applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to forecast market prices and volatility. The authors proposed a thorough approach to compute the sentiment score and forecast the directions of the next day's market return and volatility in the case of FTSE100 stocks. In this research, we choose semiconductors, a very vibrant industry of this decade, as the sector for analyzing news and market data.  \n",
            "After a review of the literature on NLP and Changes of Measure in section 2, a detailed overview of data and methodology is presented in section 3, which includes the developments from previous sentiment equation to more sophisticated ones along with enhanced NLP forecasting methods. Building upon these foundations, we introduce in section 4, a novel probability measure, that we name ' Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure\", designed to capture the occurrence of market 'hype.\" The results and future work are discussed in section 5.\n",

            "In this paper, we present an improved NLP approach for forecasting stock return and volatility based on a hype-adjusted probability measure, P a .  \n",
            "Besides validating improvements in financial forecasting, these results lay the foundation for broader theoretical applications. A hype-adjusted probability measure is introduced to quantify and integrate market hypes, extending the framework beyond classical sentiment analysis.  \n",
            "Our model evaluates text tokens with greater accuracy, effectively capturing the influence of correlations and weights across subsets. A key advantage is its low sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial token scoring method, making it robust across varied data sources. The enhanced performance of our sentiment model is exhibited in the key result figure which shows the higher accuracy obtained in predicting market responses compared to baseline models.  \n",
            "Lastly, our hype-adjusted probability measure can arguably be valued as a theoretical bridge between the probabilistic finance of Asset Pricing and NLP prediction in Finance, two fields which are likely to intersect more and more in the near future.\n",
