# Retrieval-LLM

To run:
1. Install depedencies in the requirements.txt
2. Run the main.py
3. First time running the ```main.py```, it will take longer time because nltk donwloads, but for the second running it will be normal
4. I add the "exit", "quit", and "new chat" commands for user.
   - "exit" or "quit" if you want to exit the conversation
   - "new_chat" if you want to send new query (with no previous history chat)
