# Parsing
to avoid error in "package depedency conflict", make sure :

1. prefer to build venv first before "pip install -r requirements"
2. only install the preferred depedencies (include the version number for python) - available in requirements.txt
3. recommended to put the input pdf and output md in the same folder
